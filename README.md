# Mushroom-Classification

## Problem Statement:

The problem statement is to classify the class of mushrooms given some features of the mushrooms. 

## Dataset Used:

The given dataset mushrooms.csv contains 8124 training samples with 23 features for each sample. 

## Metrics:

We will use the accuracy score to quantify the performance of our model. The accuracy will tell us what percentage of our test data was classified correctly. The accuracy is a good metric choice because it will be easy to compare our modelâ€™s performance to that of the benchmark as it uses the same metric. Using Naive Bayes classifier, we get a accuracy of 99%. 

## Naive Bayes Classifier:

Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised classification algorithm which is based on Bayes theorem with an assumption of independence among features.
