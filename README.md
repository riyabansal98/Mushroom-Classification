# Mushroom-Classification

## Problem Statement:

The problem statement is to classify the class of mushrooms given some features of the mushrooms. 

## Dataset Used:

The given dataset mushrooms.csv contains 8124 training samples with 23 features for each sample. 

## Metrics:

We will use the accuracy score to quantify the performance of our model. The accuracy will tell us what percentage of our test data was classified correctly. The accuracy is a good metric choice because it will be easy to compare our model’s performance to that of the benchmark as it uses the same metric. Using Naive Bayes classifier, we get a accuracy of 99%. 

## Naive Bayes Classifier:


It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.
